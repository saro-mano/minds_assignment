SAGE Project - Web scrapping 
This is an assignment for the MINDS research group. Here I have scrapped a wikipedia and produced an output file in csv format.
The link of the wikipedia page is : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_in_spaceflight
Here I have scrapped the orbital launches table which contains the rocket launches for the year 2019 and have created an output whihch has outcomes as "Operational", "Successful" and "En route"
